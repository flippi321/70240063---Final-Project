• Get Hadoop working
• Implement Insert function that automatically allocates data to right DBMS
• Implement JOIN functions between tables
    - Both with and without arguments
• "Populate the empty Be-Read table by inserting newly computed records into the Be-Read table."
    - I have no clue what this means
• Query the top-5 articles with articles details (text, image, and video if existing) (involving the join of Be-Read table and Article table)
    - daily
    - weekly
    - monthly
    - Custom duration?
• Implement Monitoring of DBMS containers, showing
    - Managed data (amount and location)
    - Workload
    - etc.  
• Get actual replica consideration in our DMBS
• Distribute science Articles over both databases
    - Right now it's just given to one  
    - Mabye have dynamic allocation, where we add by id or smt?
• Find smart way to distribute queries over DMBS without going one, then the other (Unlikely to be done)


(Optional) advanced functions:
• Hot/ Cold Standby DBMSs for fault tolerance
• Expansion at the DBMS-level allowing a new DBMS server to join
• Dropping a DBMS server at will
• Data migration from one data center to others
